      "source": "## Exploratory Data Analysis: Mental Health in Tech Survey (2014)\n\n\"This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.\" The data set and a description of the data are made available at: https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey. The data set was downloaded on February 4, 2018.\n\n#### Introduction\nI'm conducting this analysis to practice my analysis and Python skills on a structured data set including loading, inspecting, wrangling, exploring, and drawing conclusions from data. I'll note my observations with each step in order to explain how I think through and approach the data set. I'll also note questions that arise at each step, although I won't explore all of them in this analysis. \n\n(I'm going to let myself do a bit more explaining throughout this analysis than I might normally do in other settings, because I hope that by erring on the side of too much detail, it will be helpful to others who are learning, too!)\n\nKaggle suggested two questions to explore, which I will also address in my analysis. Kaggle's questions are:\n\n- How does the frequency of mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location?\n- What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness or certain attitudes towards mental health in the workplace?\n\nThis analysis is a living document and I am continuing to deepen the exploration with each iteration.  I will update this occasionally with the latest version. Thank you for reading! I welcome your questions or comments. -Liz\n\n\n### Table of Contents\n- <a href=\"#step1\">Step 1: Understand where the data came from</a>\n- <a href=\"#step2\">Step 2: Load the data and packages</a>\n- <a href=\"#step3\">Step 3: Inspect the data to begin understanding it/ data profiling</a>\n- <a href=\"#step4\">Step 4: Clean up the data as identified in Step 3</a>\n- <a href=\"#step5\">Step 5: Identify patterns in the data</a>\n- <a href=\"#step6\">Step 6: Answer Kaggle's questions about the data</a>\n\n<a id=\"step1\"></a> \n### Step 1: Understand where the data came from\n\na. How was it collected? \n\n- Name: \"Annual Mental Health in Tech Survey\"\n- Sponsoring Organization: Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI)\n- Year: 2014\n- Description: \"With over 1200 responses, we believe the 2014 Mental Health in Tech Survey was the largest survey done on mental health in the tech industry.\" Since then, OSMI has conducted two more surveys, 2016 and 2017.\n- The original dataset is from Open Sourcing Mental Illness  (OSMI) and can be downloaded here. (https://osmihelp.org/research/) \n- We do not have access to information about their data collection methods.\n\nb/c. Is it a sample, and was it properly sampled?\n- Yes, it is a sample. We don't have official information about the data collection method, but it appears *not* to be a random sample (the survey link is available on their website), so we can assume that it is not representative.\n\nd.\tWas the dataset transformed in any way?\n- Unknown.\n\ne.\tAre there some known problems on the dataset?\n- Based on the previous analyses of the data (posted on Kaggle), <strong>Gender</strong> and <strong>Age</strong> will need to be cleaned up.\n- It does <em>not</em> appear that the survey was administered to a representative sample and so, we won't be able to generalize the findings to a broader population. \n\n<a id=\"step2\"></a> \n### Step 2: Load the data and packages"

I'll group the responses into fewer categories. \n- <strong>Age</strong> has some values that are too low or too high to be real ages. I'll need to decide what to do about them.\n- The following variables have null values that I may need to address. I will write out my initial thoughts on them:\n - <strong>state</strong>:  This should be null only when <strong>country</strong> is something other than the US\n - <strong>self_employed</strong>: There are 18 missing values. I'll need to investigate why. (Was it an optional question, perhaps?)\n - <strong>work-interfere</strong>:  There are 264 missing values. The question begins with \"If you have a mental health condition,...\" so I will assume that those who did not respond, did so because they do not have a mental health condition currently. This is an imperfect assumption since we can't know that for sure; and because some people may have felt the need to respond even if they don't have a mental health condition, if they did not feel comfortable leaving a question blank.\n - <strong>comments</strong>: There are 1095 missing values. It was an optional text box so it's reasonable to expect that many (most) respondents would leave it blank. We may be able to learn something by doing a text analysis on the submitted comments: are there themes that come up in the comments that would inform the next version of the survey - for example, a popular theme might justify creating its own multiple-choice question next time.\n"

So this is an imperfect solution, but I still consider it a reasonable one given what we have available to us.\n\n#### Questions that come up:\n- How does <strong>gender</strong> relate to various behaviors and/or their awareness of their employer's attitude toward mental health?\n\n#### 4E: Decide how to handle NaN data in the categorical columns\n- There are three variables with many missing values. None of them points to a need to \"fill in\" the missing responses or delete the rows. More detail:\n - <strong>state</strong>:  the missing values are likely to occur in the instances where the country is not \"United States\". This can be confirmed below.\n - <strong>work_intefere</strong>:  the missing values indicate that the respondent skipped the question because it does not apply to them, which is important information. We can infer that missing responses means the respondent is not experiencing a mental illness at the moment. \n - <strong>comments</strong>:  this missing values indicate that the respondent didn't leave a comment, which was optional.\n \n##### Questions that come up:\n- How many values for <strong>state</strong> are blank when the <strong>country</strong> is \"United States\"? In other words, when <strong>state</strong> shouldn't be blank?\n\n<a id=\"step5\"></a>\n### Step 5: Identify patterns in the data\n\n#### 5A: treatment v. work_interfere\n\n##### Questions that come up: \n- Is it possible to run an accurate correlation calculation with two categorical variables?
